# THIS IS A DRAFT

# COVID-19 Analysis for President Gitanas Nausėda of the Republic of Lithuania
As the lead data scientist for the government of the Republic of Lithuania, I was given a personal mission by President Gitanas Nausėda to prepare the nation for a possible next wave of the Corona virus pandemic. South Korea has been one of the more successful nations in the fight against COVID-19, so I decided to analyze the available COVID-19 data on South Korea to learn of their success strategies, their pitfalls. In my analysis, I will determine what I have learned that can be applied here in Lithuania.

As of the date of this analysis, February 25, 2022, the COVID-19 numbers from South Korea are as follows:

- Confirmed Cases: 2,665,077
- Deaths: 7,783
- Recovered: 969,524

The first known case of COVID-19 in South Korea was on January 20, 2020 when a 35-year-old Chinese woman arrived at Incheon Airport from Wuhan and tested positive. By early March, approximately forty days after its first confirmed case South Korea became the second most infected country after China. South Korea undertook a massive public and private sector effort to fashion a national response to the pandemic.

The South Korean response is distinct in several respects:

- Early: An early and almost immediate response after the first case on January 20.
- Speed: A premium on moving as quickly as possible in setting up a testing regime.
- Transparency: Real-time and frequent information dissemination to the public.
- Public-Private sector: Enlisting companies with needed resources in a private-public sector response.
- National organization: Organized as a national effort rather than at the city, provincial, or local levels.

I will utilize the following datasets from Kaggle which contain data from January to June 2020:

1. Age: Confirmed and deceased cases based on age groups
2. Gender: Confirmed and deceased cases based on gender, male or female
3. Province: Confirmed and deceased cases based on province
4. Patient: Confirmed and deceased cases based on age, gender, method of 5. infection, province and city
5. Case: Confirmed cases based on method of infection, province, city, and specific location
6. Population: Count and ratio of academic organizations, nursing homes and elderly population
7. Test: Number of tests and number of negative and positive results.


## Goals
The goal of this project is to present the report of my analysis of the South Korean datasets to President Gitanas Nausėda and provide the government of the Republic of Lithuania with recommendations on how to prepare of a possible next wave of the Corona virus pandemic. I will concentrate on the following topics:

Total Numbers
Effect of Population Density
Effect of Weather
Effect of Testing
Effect of Travel
Some Ideas for Analysis
